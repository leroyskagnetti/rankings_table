# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
#mike = User.create({name: 'Mike'})
#hilary = User.create({name: 'Hilary'})
#emma = User.create({name: 'Emma'})
#panda = User.create({name: 'Panda'})
#match = DoublesMatch.new
#match.winner0 = mike
#match.winner1 = hilary
#match.loser0 = emma
#match.loser1 = panda
#match.save
